Monthly Income by Job Satisfaction Level (Summary Stats):
There isn't a strong direct correlation between income level and job satisfaction. Employees across all satisfaction levels show similar income ranges.
| JobSatisfaction   | count   | mean    | std     | min   | 25%    | 50%    | 75%    | max   |
|:------------------|:--------|:--------|:--------|:------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:------|

--- 6. Performance & Development ---

Performance Rating Distribution:
The majority of employees (1244 individuals) are rated as 'Good', with 226 rated 'Outstanding'. The distribution is skewed towards higher ratings.
| PerformanceRating   | count   |
|:--------------------|:--------|
| Good                | 1244    |
| Outstanding         | 226     |

Training Times Last Year & Attrition Impact:
Employees received training an average of 2.80 times last year. Interestingly, those who stayed received slightly more training (2.83 times) than those who left (2.62 times).
|       | TrainingTimesLastYear   |
|:------|:------------------------|
| count | 1470                    |
| mean  | 2.79932                 |
| std   | 1.28927                 |

| 50%   | 3                       |
| 75%   | 3                       |
| max   | 6                       |

Years Since Last Promotion vs. Attrition:
Employees who left had, on average, fewer years since their last promotion (1.95 years) compared to those who stayed (2.23 years). This suggests that slower career progression is a factor in attrition.

Years With Current Manager vs. Attrition:
Leavers spent significantly less time with their current manager (2.85 years) than stayers (4.37 years). Frequent manager changes or shorter tenures with managers could contribute to attrition.

Correlation: Job Involvement vs. Performance Rating:
The correlation between Job Involvement and Performance Rating is -0.00. This very weak correlation suggests that an employee's perceived involvement in their job doesn't strongly predict their formal performance rating in this dataset.

--- 7. Advanced Attrition Prediction ---
This section outlines the process for building machine learning models to predict employee attrition:
1.  Feature Encoding: Convert all categorical features into numerical formats (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
2.  Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
3.  Model Training: Apply algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
4.  Feature Importance: Identify the strongest predictors of attrition from the trained models.
5.  Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.

--- 9. Insights & HR Recommendations ---
This final section synthesizes all the analysis into actionable insights and recommendations. Here are examples of how you would articulate these points based on the data generated above:

Key Attrition Risk Groups:
- Young, Single Employees: This demographic (especially 18-30 year olds) consistently shows higher attrition rates. Targeted mentorship, career development plans, and community-building initiatives could be beneficial.
- Sales Representatives & Laboratory Technicians: These roles experience unusually high turnover. Investigate workload, compensation equity, and career path clarity within these departments.
- Employees Working Overtime/Long Commutes: High overtime and longer commute distances correlate with higher attrition. Review staffing levels, flexible work options, and commute support programs.
- Employees with Low Satisfaction or Stock Options: Low job/environment satisfaction and lack of stock options are strong indicators of potential attrition. Implement regular satisfaction surveys, address feedback promptly and review stock option eligibility.

Compensation & Career Progression Considerations:
- While income generally increases with job level, ensure compensation is competitive specifically for high-risk roles like Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians, where attrition is high despite potentially lower pay relative to other roles.
- Promotions & Managerial Relationships: Employees with shorter tenures in their current role/company and less time with their current manager are more prone to attrition. Focus on clear promotion pathways and training for managers to build strong, supportive relationships with their teams.
- Work-Life Balance Initiatives: Implement policies that promote better work-life balance, such as flexible hours, remote work options, or caps on overtime, especially for roles prone to burnout.
- Managerial Training: Equip managers with skills to foster employee engagement, provide regular feedback and support career growth to improve retention within their teams.
- Review Compensation Structure: Conduct a deeper dive into compensation fairness, particularly for roles and demographics identified as high-risk, and consider adjustments where inequities exist.
- Enhance Satisfaction Drivers: Actively address factors contributing to low job and environment satisfaction through direct feedback mechanisms and actionable improvements.
